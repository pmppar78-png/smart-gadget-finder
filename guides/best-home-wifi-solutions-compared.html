            <h2>Why Wi-Fi Coverage Is Still a Problem in 2025</h2>
            <p>
              Despite advances in wireless technology, dead zones remain the most common home networking complaint. The culprits are usually the same: single routers trying to cover multi-story homes, walls made of signal-blocking materials, and the explosion of connected devices competing for bandwidth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that solutions have improved dramatically. Wi-Fi 6 and 6E offer faster speeds and better handling of multiple devices. Mesh systems have matured into genuinely simple plug-and-play products. But choosing between options still requires understanding what actually matters for your situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This guide compares three main approaches to whole-home Wi-Fi: mesh systems, traditional routers, and range extenders. We'll help you understand which makes sense for your home size, internet speed, and budget.

            <h2>Quick Comparison: Mesh vs. Router vs. Extender</h2>

            <div class="guide-comparison-table">
              <h3>Mesh Wi-Fi Systems</h3>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Homes over 1,500 sq ft, multi-story layouts, or anywhere a single router leaves dead zones.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Seamless roaming (devices switch access points automatically), easy setup, consistent coverage, single network name</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher upfront cost ($200-600), can be overkill for small spaces</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> 3,000-7,500+ sq ft depending on number of units</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Traditional Routers</h3>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Apartments and smaller homes under 1,500 sq ft where a single device can cover everything.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Lower cost ($100-250), maximum performance from single point, more control for power users</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited range, complex setup for advanced features, no seamless roaming</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> 1,000-2,500 sq ft depending on model and walls</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Range Extenders</h3>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Extending coverage to one specific room without replacing existing equipment.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheapest option ($30-80), keeps existing router, minimal setup</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Creates separate network, cuts speed in half, no seamless handoff, often just masks the problem</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Adds 500-1,500 sq ft</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-tip">
              <strong>Our recommendation:</strong> For most homes in 2025, mesh Wi-Fi is the right answer. The price gap between mesh and traditional routers has shrunk significantly, and mesh systems eliminate the headaches of range extenders. Only consider a single router if you live in a small apartment, or an extender if you need a quick fix for one problem room.

            <h2>Understanding Wi-Fi Standards: What Actually Matters</h2>

            <h3>Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)</h3>
            <p>
              Still functional but aging. Maximum speeds around 1.3 Gbps theoretical. If you're buying new equipment, there's no reason to choose Wi-Fi 5 — price differences with Wi-Fi 6 are minimal.
            </p>

            <h3>Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)</h3>
            <p>
              The current sweet spot. Better at handling multiple devices simultaneously, improved battery life for connected devices, faster speeds in congested environments. Most devices sold today support Wi-Fi 6.
            </p>

            <h3>Wi-Fi 6E</h3>
            <p>
              Adds the 6 GHz band, providing more channels with less interference. The catch: most devices don't support 6E yet, and the 6 GHz signal has shorter range. Worth considering if you have many new devices and need maximum performance for activities like VR streaming or 4K video editing.
            </p>

            <h3>Wi-Fi 7</h3>
            <p>
              Just arriving in 2025 with even faster speeds and lower latency. Currently expensive and overkill for most users. Wait unless you're building for 5+ years out.
            </p>

            <div class="guide-tip">
              <strong>Practical advice:</strong> Wi-Fi 6 is the right choice for most buyers today. It's mature, well-priced, and widely supported. Wi-Fi 6E makes sense if you have gigabit internet and many newer devices. Skip Wi-Fi 7 for now — it'll be better and cheaper in a year.

            <h2>When a Traditional Router Makes Sense</h2>
            <p>
              Don't write off traditional routers entirely. They're still the better choice in specific situations:
            </p>

            <h3>Small Apartments (Under 1,200 sq ft)</h3>
            <p>
              A single well-positioned router handles most apartments fine. You're paying extra for mesh nodes you don't need.
            </p>

            <h3>Open Floor Plans</h3>
            <p>
              If your home has few walls and the router can be centrally located, one powerful router may cover everything.
            </p>

            <h3>Maximum Performance in One Location</h3>
            <p>
              Gamers or professionals who need the absolute fastest speeds at their desk may prefer a high-end router positioned near their setup, rather than distributed mesh coverage.
            </p>

            <h3>Recommended Traditional Routers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Best overall:</strong> ASUS RT-AX86U Pro (~$250) — Wi-Fi 6, gaming features, great range</li>
              <li><strong>Budget pick:</strong> TP-Link Archer AX55 (~$120) — Wi-Fi 6, solid performance, simple setup</li>
              <li><strong>Power user:</strong> Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500 (~$400) — Wi-Fi 6E, extreme performance</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>How to Choose Based on Your Home</h2>

            <h3>Under 1,500 sq ft, One Floor</h3>
            <p>
              A single Wi-Fi 6 router will likely suffice. Place it centrally and test coverage before buying more equipment.
            </p>

            <h3>1,500-3,000 sq ft or Two Floors</h3>
            <p>
              Mesh Wi-Fi is almost always the right choice. A 2-pack system should cover this range. Place one unit on each floor, connected by wireless or Ethernet backhaul if possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Over 3,000 sq ft or Three+ Floors</h3>
            <p>
              Go with a 3-pack mesh system. Consider wired backhaul (Ethernet between units) for maximum reliability if you can run cables.
            </p>

            <h3>Thick Walls (Brick, Concrete, Plaster)</h3>
            <p>
              Dense wall materials cut Wi-Fi range significantly. Add an extra mesh node or place units closer together. Wired backhaul helps tremendously here.
            </p>

            <h3>Many Smart Home Devices (30+)</h3>
            <p>
              Look for Wi-Fi 6 or newer systems designed for many simultaneous connections. The TP-Link Deco X55 and Eero Pro 6E handle large device counts well.
            </p>

            <div class="guide-tip">
              <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Your internet speed should match your equipment. If you pay for 500 Mbps, a Wi-Fi 5 router might bottleneck you. If you have 100 Mbps, an expensive Wi-Fi 6E system won't make your internet faster — just more reliable throughout your home.
            </div>
          </section>

          <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>Common Wi-Fi Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h3>Placing the Router in a Corner</h3>
            <p>
              Routers broadcast in all directions. Putting one in a corner wastes half its signal into walls and outdoors. Centralize it.
            </p>

            <h3>Hiding Equipment in Cabinets</h3>
            <p>
              Wood, metal, and other cabinet materials block signals. Routers and mesh nodes need open placement for best performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Using Old Coaxial Splitters</h3>
            <p>
              If your internet comes through coax cable, old or excessive splitters reduce signal quality. This limits speed before Wi-Fi even enters the picture.
            </p>

            <h3>Not Using Wired Backhaul When Available</h3>
            <p>
              If you can run Ethernet between mesh nodes, do it. Wired backhaul dramatically improves performance compared to wireless mesh communication.
            </p>

            <h3>Buying Based on Advertised Speeds</h3>
            <p>
              "AX6000" doesn't mean 6,000 Mbps real-world speed. Marketing numbers combine theoretical maximums across all bands. Real-world performance is much lower.

            <h2>Our Editorial Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Smart Gadget Finder exists to solve a real problem: making confident smart home technology decisions without wading through endless marketing claims, paid placements, and spec sheets that don't translate to real-world performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We combine human editorial expertise with AI-powered personalization to deliver guidance that's actually useful — not just another "top 10 list" that reads like a product catalog.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Editorial Team</h2>
            <p>
              Our content is created and reviewed by the Smart Gadget Finder Editorial Team, a small group of technology enthusiasts and writers with backgrounds in consumer electronics, home automation, and technical writing.
            </p>

            <h3>What We Bring to the Table</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hands-on experience:</strong> We use smart home technology in our own homes — mesh Wi-Fi systems, video doorbells, robot vacuums, smart lighting, and automation setups.</li>
              <li><strong>Research-first approach:</strong> Every guide reflects hours of specification comparison, user review analysis, and understanding of real-world performance across different home environments.</li>
              <li><strong>Plain-language translation:</strong> We translate technical jargon into language anyone can understand, regardless of their tech background.</li>
              <li><strong>Budget consciousness:</strong> We understand that not everyone has unlimited budgets, so we always highlight value options alongside premium choices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Process</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Research:</strong> We analyze manufacturer specifications, independent reviews, user feedback, and real-world performance data.</li>
              <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Content is drafted by team members with expertise in the relevant category.</li>
              <li><strong>Review:</strong> All content is reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness before publication.</li>
              <li><strong>Updates:</strong> We revisit guides regularly to ensure recommendations remain current as products and markets evolve.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>Our Content Standards</h2>

            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain editorial independence from advertisers and affiliate partners. While we earn commissions when readers purchase through our links (see our <a href="disclaimer.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a>), this revenue model does not influence our recommendations. We recommend products based on quality and fit for specific use cases — not commission rates.
            </p>

            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
              We strive for factual accuracy in all our content. When we're uncertain about specifications or performance claims, we say so. If we make errors, we correct them promptly.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              We clearly disclose our business model and affiliate relationships. Every page includes affiliate disclosure banners, and we never disguise paid recommendations as editorial content.
            </p>

            <h3>User Focus</h3>
            <p>
              Our primary obligation is to readers seeking honest guidance. We prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness and practical advice over technical depth for its own sake.
            </p>

          <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>AI Assistant Standards</h2>
            <p>
              Our AI assistant uses advanced language models to provide personalized recommendations based on information you share during your conversation. The AI is guided by the same editorial principles as our written content:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clarification first:</strong> The AI asks questions to understand your specific situation before recommending products.</li>
              <li><strong>Explanation included:</strong> Recommendations come with reasoning, not just product names and links.</li>
              <li><strong>Budget respect:</strong> The AI considers your stated budget and doesn't push premium options when budget-friendly alternatives serve your needs.</li>
              <li><strong>Honest limitations:</strong> The AI acknowledges when questions fall outside its knowledge base or when recommendations require verification.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="guide-tip">
              <strong>Important:</strong> AI-generated recommendations are starting points for your research. Always verify product specifications, availability, and prices with retailers before purchasing. Technology changes quickly, and the AI's knowledge has limitations.
            </div>

            <h2>How We Handle Affiliate Relationships</h2>
            <p>
              Smart Gadget Finder earns revenue through affiliate partnerships with major retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Newegg, and many others. Here's how this works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you click a link to a retailer and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.</li>
              <li>Commission rates vary by retailer and product category, but this variance does not influence our recommendations.</li>
              <li>We recommend products from many retailers — including those with lower commission rates — when they offer better value or selection.</li>
              <li>We never accept payment from brands or retailers in exchange for favorable reviews or placement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This affiliate model allows us to provide free guidance without requiring subscriptions, paywalls, or invasive advertising. It aligns our incentives with yours: we only succeed when we help you make purchases you're genuinely happy with.
            </p>
